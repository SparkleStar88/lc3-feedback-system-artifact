To replicate the VSCode part of our paper, you can either:
1) Open VSCode, search "lc3" in the extension market, the one published by qili is ours.
2) Open VSCode, go to extension tab and click on more (...), then choose "install from VSIX". We have provided the VSIX file in the replication package.
3) Build the extension from source, whcich require some work. See below.

We provide a .visx file directly in the replication package. In case someone want to build it from source, here's the guide.

To build the VSCode extension, you need the following tools/packages:
- node
- npm
- vsce

Take Ubuntu as an example, you can install node and npm with "sudo apt install nodejs npm"
Then, you can install vsce using "sudo npm install -g vsce"

After getting all the required packages, you can build the extension and generate the portable extension package by running "npm install && vsce package",
which will generate a .vsix file.

The VSCode editor can then install extensions from .vsix files (see 2).

NOTE: Authentication may be needed when packaging the extension, which need an AzureDev account. 
Please refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#create-a-publisher for how to create a publisher.
To be able to package the extension, you need to replace the "publisher" field (qili) in package.json with the publisher name of the AzureDev you are using.
